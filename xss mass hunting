1. Find as many subdomains as possible
2. cat all_subs.txt | dnsx | tee -a resolved_ones.txt
3. cat resolved_ones.txt | httpx | tee -a alive_ones.txt
4. ffuf -w /root/wordlist/api/swagger_xss.txt:FUZZ -w alive_ones.txt:URL -u URLFUZZ -mc 200 -o ffuf-result.txt
5. cat ffuf-result.txt | jq -r .results[].url | tee -a feed_me_to_httpx.txt
6. cat feed_me_to_httpx.txt | httpx -silent -title | tee -a title.txt
7. cat title.txt | grep "Swagger UI"

First Step
Find as many subdomains as possible you can get help from Chaos.

Second Step
Now itâ€™s time to resolve subdomains. If you get false positive, use ShuffleDNS with -d and -l options.

Third Step
After resolving them, we need to find alive subdomains. You can add
User-Agent, Time Delay and etc

Fourth Step
Now we are ready to fuzz for Swagger UI endpoints.

ffuf -w /root/wordlist/api/swagger_xss.txt:FUZZ -w alive_ones.txt:URL -u URLFUZZ -mc 200 -o ffuf-result.txt
Fifth Step
Extracting found URLs from ffuf result.

cat ffuf-result.txt | jq -r .results[].url | tee -a feed_me_to_httpx.txt
Sixth Step
Now, we use httpx with -title to get the title of fuzzed and possible endpoints for Swagger UI.

cat feed_me_to_httpx.txt | httpx -silent -title | tee -a title.txt
Seventh Step
cat title.txt | grep "Swagger UI"
