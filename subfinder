Install
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest

To run the tool on a target, just use the following command.
subfinder -d hackerone.com

The subdomains discovered can be piped to other tools too. For example, you can pipe the discovered subdomains to httpx which will then find running HTTP servers on the host.
echo hackerone.com | subfinder -silent | httpx -silent
